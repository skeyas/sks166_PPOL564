    "# 2. Optional extra credit/challenge exercise (1 point): impute possible judge demographic correlates of sentencing\n",
    "\n",
    "The previous exercises showed large differences in sentences between judges/differences in disparities. You become interested in how the judge's own demographic attributes are correlated with sentencing. Going back to the judge's name (`SENTENCE JUDGE`), parse their first name and try to probabilistically infer his or her gender. Then, investigate whether disparities differ between \"likely female\" and \"likely male\" judges. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note on ethics of probabilistic inference of attributes based on name**: Using names to infer demographic characteristics has become increasingly popular with the rise of \"digital trace data\" that often lacks explicit demographic fields (e.g., tweets just have usernames and profiles; academic citation networks just have author names; voter registration records sometimes just have names and not race/ethnicity). But there are many valid ethical critiques of this practice. In the case of gender, a person's assigned name at birth clearly does not always map onto their self-identified gender, both due to gender fluidity and names like \"Morgan.\" A couple critiques I link to are:\n",
